# Streaming API for XML (StAX)

This repository contains a standalone repackaging of Java Streaming API for XML (StAX).

The traditional StaX API is available with the Java SE Runtime in the `javax.xml.stream` package, but is not found in the Android runtime.

This library is the same StAX API, in fact, it's a fork of the RI (Reference Implementation) of the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173 repackaged in the `stax` package.
